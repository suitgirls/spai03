            <h1> Siddhi Pai's Biography </h1>
    <p>
        I'm Siddhi Pai and I'm going to be a sophmore at Parkland High School, located in Allentowm, PA. This upcoming school year, I will be taking photography, yearbook, BioMedical Science, and personal finance! I decided to take this class because technology interests me, and it's something I want to learn more about. I also love that this program is specifically for women. I like the "behind the scenes" work of technology and apps. It is very interesting how it all goes together to make a functioning app.

        <h2> Personal Info</h2>
        Outside of school, I love art, animals, and playing volleyball. When I get older, I want to have a job in the medical field. I have a dog named Scout, and my favorite TV show is Outer Banks. I also dogsit around my neighborhood which I love doing! I've always had a passion for animals of all sorts, and when I get older I hope to have a <strong>bunch</strong> of pets.
