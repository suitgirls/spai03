            <h2>All about Mary Louise Prather</h2>
            <p>Siddhi Pai / July 22, 2025</p>
            <p>
                Mary Louise Prather, born on February 23, 1905, was a pioneering woman in the field of cryptology. She played an important role in World War II. Before World War II she was a civilian worker for the Army, in William Friedman’s cryptology operation. She ran the office machinery, which had been hacked to handle the work of codebreaking. She was also in charge of filing at the time. She got her first job which the Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) as a civilian stenographer in 1938.

                During World War II, she was involved in cryptography, where she transmitted information to American forces in the Pacific to counter the Japanese attacks. Prather’s memory and organization led to a vital breakthrough on the solution to the Purple, a Japanese diplomatic code. William Friedman’s team broke through just before the war and proved invaluable for the duration. William Friedman recommended Prather for a medal and his recommendation said, “To Miss Mary Louise Prather credit should be given for the careful keeping of the records and the index to all messages and it was as a result of her painstaking attention to detail that a paraphrased message was found which formed a very important link to the solution.” At the conclusion of the war in 1946, she was awarded the Commendation for Meritorious Civilian Service Award. After the war, she continued to work in the offices of cryptography. Her position continued increasing until her biggest and final promotion to Chief of the Soviet Information Division, in 1960. In 1969, Prather retired. She was awarded another Commendation for Meritorious Civilian Service award at the end of her career.
