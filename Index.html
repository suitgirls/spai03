        My name is Siddhi Pai. I'm going to be a sophmore at Parkland High School, located in Allentowm, PA. I decided to take this class because technology interests me, and it's something I want to learn more about. I also love that this program is specifically for women. I like the "behind the scenes" work of technology and apps. It is very interesting how it all goes together to make a functioning app. Outside of school, I love art, animals, and playing volleyball. I have a dog named Scout, and my favorite TV show is Outer Banks. I've always had a passion for animals of all sorts, and when I get older I hope to have a bunch of pets.
